# How to contribute

## Your first contribution

- Best to first create an issue and discuss the problem and possible solution.
  - This isn't needed for small/obvious fixes.
  - What is the context? e.g. what versions of go-mysql, MySQL, etc does this apply to?
  - Do you have a simple test case? This can just be example code, it doesn't have to be a full test case.
  - Why do you need this change?
- Format your code with [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) if possible. (`make fmt` does this for you)
- Reference an issue in the PR if you have one.
- Update the `README.md` if applicable.
- Add tests where applicable.

## Asking for help

- Don't be afraid to ask for help in an issue or PR.
